Cascading makes Sense only for Parent-Child Association.
Cascading from Child to Parent Can be disastrous.

CascadeType.PERSIST - Saves Parent along with Child Entity 
CascadeType.MERGE   - When you are doing update on parent, same operation will be applied to Child to merge.
CascadeType.REFRESH - When you are loading Fresh Parent Entity, the Child will be loaded as Fresh Entity
