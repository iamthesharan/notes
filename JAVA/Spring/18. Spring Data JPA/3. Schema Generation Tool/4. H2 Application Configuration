lets say your h2 database has a test scope in application and you also want it during the application run.
So for that you can create a profile and add the h2 dependency without test scope.

<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>h2</id>
        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
                <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>
    </profile>
</profiles>
