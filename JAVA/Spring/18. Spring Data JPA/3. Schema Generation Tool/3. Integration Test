So if you create a Test Class to test the DAO Layer.
you will put @DataJpaTest. 
And From the Command Liner you will be adding the Data into the Repository.

Let's say you have 2 Profiles one for Local and other one is the default.
the Default Profile has h2 Configuration sets to True,
whereas the local profile has mysql Configuration.

So if You want to run the Test only in local ie. the Profile with mysql Database?
Then You Should provide @ActiveProfile("local") over the Test Class.
Note** Active Profiles are only used in TEst Cases to activate the Profile While Running


Also in the Command Liner from where you're putting the data for testing in the Repository, 
over that class you need to specify @Profile("local") depending on the Test Case.


When you use @DataJapTest over the Test class, Spring will Override the Datasource to h2 by Default.
To avoid this you need to use annotation:
@AutoConfigureTestDatabase(replace = AutoConfigureTestDatabase.Replace.NONE) over the Test Class
