There are four Autditing Annotation:
@CreatedDate
@CreatedBy
@LastModifiedDate
@LastModifiedBy


These Annotation you should Provide at Base Entity.
Also Over Base Entity you should use @MappedSuperClass
Also add @EntityListeners(AuditingEntityListener.class) over base entity class
This Listner will keep Listening any Changes made to the Record.


Another thing need to Do:
Create a class implementing AuditAware Interface

@Component
class AuditAwareImpl implements AuditAware<String> {

}


And in Main Class use the annotations
@EnableJpaAuditing(auditorAwareRef = "auditAwareImpl")
