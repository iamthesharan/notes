The Repository Pattern is a design pattern commonly used in software development to abstract 
the data access layer from the rest of the application. 

It provides a way to centralize and manage the logic for data storage, retrieval, and manipulation

Here are some key components and concepts associated with the Repository Pattern:

Repository Interface:
Defines a set of methods for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a specific entity or aggregate root.
Typically includes methods like Add, Get, Update, Delete, and other relevant operations.

Concrete Repository:
Implements the repository interface and provides the actual implementation for data access.
Interacts with the underlying data storage (such as a database) to execute the CRUD operations.

Entity:
Represents the domain object or data model for which the repository provides data access.
It could be a simple class or a more complex aggregate root with associated entities.

Unit of Work:
Often used in conjunction with the Repository Pattern, the Unit of Work pattern manages the transactional boundaries and ensures that a series of related operations are treated as a single unit.
Helps to maintain data consistency and integrity.



Benefits:

Abstraction: The rest of the application is not concerned with the details of data access, making it easier to change the data storage implementation without affecting the rest of the code.
Testability: By using interfaces and dependency injection, it becomes easier to mock the data access layer for unit testing.
Separation of Concerns: The business logic is separated from the data access logic, leading to a more modular and maintainable codebase.



Drawbacks:

Complexity: For small projects or simple data access requirements, the overhead of implementing the Repository Pattern might be considered unnecessary.
Abstraction Overhead: In some cases, the abstraction provided by the repository might leak details that are not appropriate for certain scenarios.
